# learning-E2E-channel-coding-with-diffusion-models
This repository contains the simulations used in the paper [1]. It is open to the public, so please feel free to play around or use it for your research, study, education, etc.
In the repository, there are notebook files enabling an end-to-end (E2E) framework for each of three channel models: AWGN channel, real Rayleigh fading channel, and a channel model with solid-state power amplifier (SSPA). 
The E2E framework's final goal is to learn a pair of a neural encoder and a neural decoder achieving a small symbol error rate.
In the real world, the channel models are not clearly known nor differentiable, 
so we learn the channel distribution by using a diffusion model and replace the channel block with a synthesized channel sampled by the learned diffusion model.
Please refer to our papers for more details. You can find the links of them below. 
This repository has the source code that can reproduce the simulations in the paper and some visualizations that can help understanding.
